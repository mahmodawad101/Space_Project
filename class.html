            There are many star classification systems in use today, however,
            the Morgan-Keenan system is the easiest to understand. Stars are
            classified in this system using letters O, B, A, F, G, K, and M.
            They are classified based on their temperature the hottest is O
            and the coolest is M. The temperature of each spectral class is
            then subdivided by the addition of a

                These types of stars are quite rare with spectral types of
                either O or B. They have a mass around 2.5 to 90 times that of
                the sun and last about 40 million years They usually reside in
                the arms of spiral galaxies and are charact erized by the

                stars are mistake nly referred to as Gtype stars. Our Sun is a

                have a mass of 0.45 to 0.8 that of our sun and last around 15
                to 30 billion years They emit less UV radiatio n and remain
                stable for long periods of time making them very favorab le
                for exopla nets These stars have a prevalen ce of around 73%,
                with either spectral types K M.. and it last around several
                trillion years. They account for the bulk of the Milky Way’s
                stellar populatio n, though they are very dim. If red dwarfs
                are more massive than 0.35 solar masses, they convert When a
                star runs out of hydroge n it begins to burn its helium thus
                it transfor ms into either a giant or supergia nt star. Its
                core collapses and it gets hotter, resulting in the outer
                layer to expand outwards . Stars that are either low or medium
                in mass evolved into red giants. Stars with highmass, around
                These stars are very rare, their spectral types are O, B, and
                A. They have a mass of 2 to 150 that of our sun and last
                around 10 to 100 million years. There are a wide variety of
                stars termed blue giants. Many stars with luminosit y
                classifica tions of III and II are referred to as blue giants
                merely These stars are also rare, spectral type OB. They have
                a mass of around 20 to 1.000 that of our sun and live very
                short lives, around 10 million years. These stars have a
                prevalen ce of around 0.4%, spectral types M, K.. They have a
                mass of about 0.3 to 10 and live around 0.1 to 2 billion
                years.Th ey are much smaller than red supergia nts and much
                less massive. The RBGbranch is the most common, with hydroge n
                still being fused into helium, These stars have a prevalen ce
                of around 0.0001% , spectral types K, M. They have a mass of
                about 10 to 40 that of our sun and live around 3 to 100
                million years. These stars have exhauste d their supplies of
                hydroge n at their cores. Because of this, their outer layers
                expand hugely as These stars have a prevalen ce of around
                0.4%, spectral type D. ,They have a mass of about 0.1 to 1.4
                that of our sun and live around 100.000 to 10 billion years.
                These stars no longer produce energy to countera ct their
                mass. Theoreti cally, they cannot exceed 1.4 solar masses.
                Some These stars have a prevalen ce of around 0.7%, spectral
                type D. They live around 100.000 to 10 billion years. Neutron
                stars are basically the collapsed cores of massive stars that
                were compres sed beyond the white dwarf stage during a
                supernov a explosio n. They consist of neutron particles These
                stars are more hypothetical in nature. They are theorized to
                be white dwarfs that have radiated away all their leftover
                heat and light. Since white dwarfs have relatively high life
                spans, no black dwarfs had enough time to form yet. If such
                stars would form, this would occur after our Sun will die.
                Small stars may become white dwarfs or neutron stars but stars
                with high masses become black holes after a supernova
                explosion. Since the remnant has no outward pressure to oppose
                the force of gravity, it will continue to collapse into a
                gravitational singularity and eventually become a black hole.
                These stars have a prevalence of around 1% to 1.0%, and range
                between spectral types M, L, T, Y. . They have a mass of about
                0.01 to 0.08 that of our sun and live for possibly trillions
                of years. on lines in their spectra. .Becaus e of their mass
                and tempera ture, they have short life spans that end in a
                superno va explosio n resultin g in either black holes or
                neutron stars. Some example s of blue stars: Delta Circini,

                away all their

                this would occur
                after our Sun will
                die.

      <h2> Stars life cycle</h2>
      <p>Stars form in huge clouds of gas and dust. Gravity causes these clouds to contract thus drawing the gas
        closer. As these materials accumulate in the center, density raises and pressure increases.This causes the
        matter to heat up and glow while the mass increases. Temperatures and pressure continually grow until
        hydrogen can be fused. The heat generated by this nuclear fusion causes the gas to expand and when
        hydrostatic equilibrium is reached, the star is born. Most stars form in groups called star clusters, many are
        eventually ejected from these clusters.</p></div>

        <h2>Star variability</h2>
        <p>What do you know about stellar variability?
          •Variable stars are stars that change brightness. The brightness changes of these stars can range
          from a thousandth of a magnitude to as much as twenty magnitudes over periods of a fraction of a
          second to years, depending on the type of variable star.
          •Over 1,000,000 variable stars are known and catalogued, and many thousands more are
          suspected to be variable.
          •reasons why variable stars change their brightness.
          example, swell and shrink due to internal forces. An eclipsing binary will dim when it is eclipsed by
          a faint companion,
          Some variable stars are extremely close pairs of stars, exchanging mass as one star strips the
          atmosphere from the other.
          •Variable stars are classified as either intrinsic, wherein variability is caused by physical changes
          such as pulsation or eruption in the star or stellar system, or extrinsic, wherein variability is caused
          by the eclipse of one star by another, the transit of an extrasolar planet (exoplanet), or by the
          effects of stellar rotation.</p>

          <h2> Kns 2011d
          </h2>
          <p>a supernova shockwave has been observed in the optical wavelength or visible light as it reaches
            the surface of the star. This early flash of light is called a shock breakout. The explosive death of
            this star, called KSN 2011d, as it reaches its maximum brightness takes 14 days. The shock breakout
            itself lasts only about 20 minutes.
            KSN 2011d, is roughly 500 times the size of our sun and around 1.2 billion light years away.This
            type of star is called a red supergiant star and it is 20,000 times brighter than our sun. As the
            supergiant star goes supernova, the energy traveling from the core reaches the surfaces with a
            burst of light that is 130,000,000 times brighter than the sun. The star continues to explode and
            grow reaching maximum brightness that is about 1,000,000,000 times brighter than the sun</p>
